## Introduction



The mission of IC 2023 is to provide a pioneering technology map through searching and advancing state-of-the-art and state-of-the-practice in processors, systems, algorithms, and applications for machine learning, deep learning, spiking neural network and other AI techniques across multidisciplinary and interdisciplinary areas. The BenchCouncil staff will invite worldwide contributors to showcase their superior chips, systems, algorithms and applications. IC 2023 also solicits manuscripts describing original work in the above areas.

IC 2023 invites manuscripts describing original work in the above areas and topics. All accepted papers will be presented at the IC 2023 conference and published by Springer CCIS (Indexed by EI). 



With generous support from BenchCouncil, IC 2023 will offer travel grants for students to defray a portion of their travel cost. The size and number of these grants will vary depending on funding availability, the number of student applicants, and their respective priority. Grant awards will be made before the early registration deadline; expenses will be reimbursed after the conference; grant recipients will be asked to submit original receipts to verify their expenditures as well as a 1-page summary of their involvement during the conference. While we encourage all in need of a travel grant to apply, the selection process will give higher priority to students who would otherwise not be able to attend the conference. We strongly encourage applications from students that belong to under-represented groups.
